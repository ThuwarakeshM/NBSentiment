It is amazing how quickly this new beautiful school was opened.My two sons are taking lessons at Big Blue for over two years now. We fallowed Glenn the manager from Buffalo Grove where we started to Niles where he continues to take excellent care of my two boys. Glen had to face many challenges with my little one who in the beginning refused to even be in the water not saying to place his had under the water. He found him fun, playful teacher who he coached over the lessons to get through tough beginnings. He keeps taking care of this stubborn munchkin, looking after him and getting in the water by himself if it's necessary, every week when we come. Talking and explaining everything to his worried mom.
